                Balern Education was originally founded by xu zhen qiang a.k.a "Gourd".
            	Balern Education was opened so that Gourd could share his passion of drums with a younger generation. His vision was to bring a new era of talented young people to shape the landscape for a new China.

                As time progressed and Balern grew Gourd realized people wanted to learn drums as much as he wanted to teach it.

                Balern hopes to infuse arts and English into your child's life to pave a road for a better tomorrow.
