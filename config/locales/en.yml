But, just because your child is isn't in class now, that doesn't mean their opportunities to learn should cease. Here you can find some great learning materials. We use all of these materials at Balern. It's reccomended that all of our currently enrolled students purchase their own textbook. This provides you with the ability to help your child study outside of the classroom as well."
